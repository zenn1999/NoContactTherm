# NoContactTherm
No contact thermometer

This was built to get a quick look at my body temperature. It is pretty straight forward. Just use the screen to visualize the area to be measured and when ready push the button for a second and it will measuse the all pixels above 34 celcius and display the hottest one. At the time of this writing you also have to turn it off and on again in between measurments to clear the hottest pixel. This will change though and i am also working on a better case design. I will update this as i make changes.
